# Python → Jac Mastery Journey 🚀

This repository documents my **structured journey** from mastering Python 🐍  
to building **AI-native applications** with **Jac** ⚡, following a detailed 6-stage roadmap.

## 📌 About
- **Python**: Basics → Intermediate → Advanced → AI & Backend  
- **Jac**: Basics → Core Concepts → AI Integration → Capstones  
- Includes **notes, exercises, mini-projects, and portfolio projects**.  
- All progress tracked in **journal.md**.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `pythonBasics/` → Python syntax, control flow, functions, basics  
- `pythonIntermediate/` → Collections, files, error handling, modular code  
- `pythonAdvanced/` → OOP, decorators, generators, regex  
- `pythonAiBackend/` → REST APIs, databases, AI/ML foundations  
- `jacBasics/` → Jac syntax, graphs, walkers  
- `jacCore/` → Traversals, persistence, advanced graph modeling  
- `jacAi/` → AI/NLP integration, neurosymbolic functions  
- `capstoneProjects/` → Portfolio-ready Python + Jac projects  

## 🗓️ Learning Roadmap
- Full step-by-step plan → [roadmap.md](./roadmap.md)  
- Daily/weekly reflections → [journal.md](./journal.md)  

## 🎯 Goals
By the end of this journey:
- Become **fluent in Python and Jac**  
- Build **6–8 solid projects** (from mini-apps to AI-native systems)  
- Be ready to **design, build, and deploy AI-native applications** with confidence
